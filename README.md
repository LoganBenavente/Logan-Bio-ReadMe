# Logan-Bio-ReadMe
My name is Logan Benavente. I'm a very creative person interested in game development. My goal is to one day work on coding video games. I hope that by learning to use Github, I will learn skills that will help me in the future when I'm coding projects with other people and we have to keep committing new versions.
